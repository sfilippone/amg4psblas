!  From a given AC to final format, generating DESC_AC.
!  This is quite involved, because in the context of aggregation based
!  on parallel matching we are building the matrix hierarchy within BLD_TPROL
!  as we go, especially if we have multiple sweeps, hence this code is called
!  in two completely different contexts:
!  1. Within bld_tprol for the internal hierarchy
!  2. Outside, from amg_hierarchy_bld
!  The solution we have found is for bld_tprol to copy its output
!  into special components ag%ac ag%desc_ac etc so that:
!  1. if they are  allocated, it means that bld_tprol has been already invoked, we are in
!     amg_hierarchy_bld and we only need to copy them
!  2. If they are not allocated, we are within bld_tprol, and we need to actually
!     perform the various needed steps.
!
! Arguments:
!    ag       -  type(amg_d_parmatch_aggregator_type), input/output.
!               The aggregator object
!    parms   -  type(amg_dml_parms), input
!               The aggregation parameters
!    a          -  type(psb_dspmat_type), input.
!                  The sparse matrix structure containing the local part of
!                  the fine-level matrix.
!    desc_a     -  type(psb_desc_type), input.
!                  The communication descriptor of the fine-level matrix.
!                  The 'one-level' data structure that will contain the local
!                  part of the matrix to be built as well as the information
!                  concerning the prolongator and its transpose.
!    ilaggr     -  integer, dimension(:), input
!                  The mapping between the row indices of the coarse-level
!                  matrix and the row indices of the fine-level matrix.
!                  ilaggr(i)=j means that node i in the adjacency graph
!                  of the fine-level matrix is mapped onto node j in the
!                  adjacency graph of the coarse-level matrix. Note that the indices
!                  are assumed to be shifted so as to make sure the ranges on
!                  the various processes do not   overlap.
!    nlaggr     -  integer, dimension(:) input
!                  nlaggr(i) contains the aggregates held by process i.
!    ac         -  type(psb_dspmat_type), inout
!                  The coarse matrix
!    desc_ac    -  type(psb_desc_type), output.
!                  The communication descriptor of the fine-level matrix.
!                  The 'one-level' data structure that will contain the local
!                  part of the matrix to be built as well as the information
!                  concerning the prolongator and its transpose.
!
!    op_prol    -  type(psb_dspmat_type), input/output
!                  The tentative prolongator on input, the computed prolongator on output
!
!    op_restr    -  type(psb_dspmat_type), input/output
!                  The restrictor operator; normally, it is the transpose of the prolongator.
!
!    info       -  integer, output.
!                  Error code.
