! Subroutine: amg_z_dec_aggregator_mat_bld
! Version:    complex
!
!  This routine builds the matrix associated to the current level of the
!  multilevel preconditioner from the matrix associated to the previous level,
!  by using the user-specified aggregation technique (therefore, it also builds the
!  prolongation and restriction operators mapping the current level to the
!  previous one and vice versa). 
!  The current level is regarded as the coarse one, while the previous as
!  the fine one. This is in agreement with the fact that the routine is called,
!  by amg_mlprec_bld, only on levels >=2.
!  The coarse-level matrix A_C is built from a fine-level matrix A
!  by using the Galerkin approach, i.e.
!
!                               A_C = P_C^T A P_C,
!
!  where P_C is a prolongator from the coarse level to the fine one.
! 
!  A mapping from the nodes of the adjacency graph of A to the nodes of the
!  adjacency graph of A_C has been computed by the amg_aggrmap_bld subroutine.
!  The prolongator P_C is built here from this mapping, according to the
!  value of p%iprcparm(amg_aggr_kind_), specified by the user through
!  amg_zprecinit and amg_zprecset.
!  On output from this routine the entries of AC, op_prol, op_restr
!  are still in "global numbering" mode; this is fixed in the calling routine
!  amg_z_lev_aggrmat_bld.
!
!  Currently four  different prolongators are implemented, corresponding to
!  four  aggregation algorithms:
!  1. un-smoothed aggregation,
!  2. smoothed aggregation,
!  3. "bizarre" aggregation.
!  4. minimum energy 
!  1. The non-smoothed aggregation uses as prolongator the piecewise constant
!     interpolation operator corresponding to the fine-to-coarse level mapping built
!     by p%aggr%bld_tprol. This is called tentative prolongator.
!  2. The smoothed aggregation uses as prolongator the operator obtained by applying
!     a damped Jacobi smoother to the tentative prolongator.
!  3. The "bizarre" aggregation uses a prolongator proposed by the authors of AMG4PSBLAS.
!     This prolongator requires a deeper analysis and testing and its use is
!     not recommended at this time.
!  4. Minimum energy aggregation

!  The main structure is:

! 
! Arguments:
!    ag       -  type(amg_z_dec_aggregator_type), input/output.
!               The aggregator object
!    parms   -  type(amg_dml_parms), input 
!               The aggregation parameters
!    a          -  type(psb_zspmat_type), input.     
!                  The sparse matrix structure containing the local part of
!                  the fine-level matrix.
!    desc_a     -  type(psb_desc_type), input.
!                  The communication descriptor of the fine-level matrix.
!                  The 'one-level' data structure that will contain the local
!                  part of the matrix to be built as well as the information
!                  concerning the prolongator and its transpose.
!    ilaggr     -  integer, dimension(:), input
!                  The mapping between the row indices of the coarse-level
!                  matrix and the row indices of the fine-level matrix.
!                  ilaggr(i)=j means that node i in the adjacency graph
!                  of the fine-level matrix is mapped onto node j in the
!                  adjacency graph of the coarse-level matrix. Note that the indices
!                  are assumed to be shifted so as to make sure the ranges on
!                  the various processes do not   overlap.
!    nlaggr     -  integer, dimension(:) input
!                  nlaggr(i) contains the aggregates held by process i.
!    ac         -  type(psb_zspmat_type), output
!                  The coarse matrix on output 
!                  
!    op_prol    -  type(psb_zspmat_type), input/output
!                  The tentative prolongator on input, the computed prolongator on output
!               
!    op_restr    -  type(psb_zspmat_type), output
!                  The restrictor operator; normally, it is the transpose of the prolongator. 
!               
!    info       -  integer, output.
!                  Error code.
