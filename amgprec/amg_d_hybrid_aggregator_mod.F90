  !
  !   sm           -  class(amg_T_base_smoother_type), allocatable
  !                   The current level preconditioner (aka smoother).
  !   parms        -  type(amg_RTml_parms)
  !                   The parameters defining the multilevel strategy.
  !   ac           -  The local part of the current-level matrix, built by
  !                   coarsening the previous-level matrix.
  !   desc_ac      -  type(psb_desc_type).
  !                   The communication descriptor associated to the matrix
  !                   stored in ac.
  !   base_a       -  type(psb_Tspmat_type), pointer.
  !                   Pointer (really a pointer!) to the local part of the current 
  !                   matrix (so we have a unified treatment of residuals).
  !                   We need this to avoid passing explicitly the current matrix
  !                   to the routine which applies the preconditioner.
  !   base_desc    -  type(psb_desc_type), pointer.
  !                   Pointer to the communication descriptor associated to the
  !                   matrix pointed by base_a.
  !   map          -  Stores the maps (restriction and prolongation) between the
  !                   vector spaces associated to the index spaces of the previous
  !                   and current levels.
  !
  !   Methods:  
  !     Most methods follow the encapsulation hierarchy: they take whatever action
  !     is appropriate for the current object, then call the corresponding method for
  !     the contained object.
  !     As an example: the descr() method prints out a description of the
  !     level. It starts by invoking the descr() method of the parms object,
  !     then calls the descr() method of the smoother object. 
  !
  !    descr      -   Prints a description of the object.
  !    default    -   Set default values
  !    dump       -   Dump to file object contents
  !    set        -   Sets various parameters; when a request is unknown
  !                   it is passed to the smoother object for further processing.
  !    check      -   Sanity checks.
  !    sizeof     -   Total memory occupation in bytes
  !    get_nzeros -   Number of nonzeros 
  !
