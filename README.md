AMG4PSBLAS is a package of Algebraic MultiGrid (AMG)
preconditioners for  the iterative solution of large and sparse linear systems.

It is an evolution of MLD2P4 (see LICENSE.MLD2P4), but it has been
thoroughly reworked, and it is sufficiently different to warrant a new
project name.

TO COMPILE

0. Unpack the tar file in a directory of your choice (preferrably
   outside the main PSBLAS directory).
1. run configure --with-psblas=<ABSOLUTE path of the PSBLAS install directory>
   adding the options for MUMPS, SuperLU, SuperLU_Dist, UMFPACK as desired.
   See MLD2P4 User's and Reference Guide (Section 3) for details.
2. Tweak Make.inc if you are not satisfied.
3. make; 
4. Go into the test subdirectory and build the examples of your choice.
5. (if desired): make install 


NOTES

- The single precision version is supported only by MUMPS and SuperLU;
  thus, even if you specify at configure time to use UMFPACK or SuperLU_Dist, 
  the corresponding preconditioner options will be available only from
  the double precision version.
